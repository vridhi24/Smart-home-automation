# Smart-home-automation
Smart Home Automation using TinkerCAD This project demonstrates a Smart Home Automation System designed and simulated using Tinkercad. It automates home appliances like lights, fans, and security systems using sensors, ensuring energy efficiency and user convenience.
How it Works
Motion Detected: Lights turn ON when motion is detected.
No Motion: Lights automatically turn OFF.
Gas Leakage: Buzzer sounds when MQ-2 detects gas.
Temperature Control: Fan turns ON/OFF based on temperature reading from DHT11.
Manual Mode: Push buttons used to override automatic behavior.
