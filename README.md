## 📘 Project Summary  
This project simulates a **Smart Home Automation System** using TinkerCAD. It automates the control of **lights, fans, and safety alerts** using sensors, providing improved **energy efficiency**, **security**, and **user comfort**. The system includes both **automatic sensing** and **manual override** modes.

## ⚙️ Features

| Feature               | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🚶‍♀️ Motion Detection    | Lights turn **ON** when motion is detected (PIR sensor).                  |
| 😴 Auto-Off Lighting   | Lights turn **OFF** automatically after no motion is sensed.               |
| 🔥 Gas Leakage Alert   | **MQ-2 sensor** detects gas/smoke → activates **buzzer** alert.            |
| 🌡 Temperature Control | **DHT11 sensor** controls fan based on ambient temperature.                |
| 🖲 Manual Override     | Push buttons allow manual control of lights and fans.                      |
